Lightweight utility library for cross platform game development. 

Provides a uniform interface for rendering, audio playback, text rendering
and collision detection. [Reference documentation is available](http://morganbengtsson.github.io/mo/).

OpenGL and OpenAL are used under the hood for rendering and audio. Together
with smaller libraries for ogg decoding, png loading and math.
